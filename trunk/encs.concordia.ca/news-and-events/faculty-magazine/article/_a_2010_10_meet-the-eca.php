But above all, this Faculty prides itself on its students: a diverse group of bright young people driven to succeed in today's fast-paced technological world.<br /><br />Representing our large multinational undergraduate student body is a dedicated team of individuals brought together under the banner of the Engineering and Computer Science Association, or the ECA. Formed of a team of eight elected executives, four departmental representatives, several directors, and supported by many targeted societies, the ECA works to ensure our undergraduates have an outstanding experience while studying engineering or computer science here at Concordia. <br /><br />Whether they are planning academic happenings or fun-focused events, the ECA operates in the best interests of the students. Starting off with Orientation and Frosh, the ECA welcomes new students into the fold with what basically amounts to a two-week-long party. That party continues throughout the year with regularly scheduled events such as Lizard Lounge, movie nights, karaoke, Engineering Week, and much more. They're also responsible for the engineering apparel that can be seen sported by students all over campus. <br /><br />To bring the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science a little closer to this year's ECA team, the Faculty Quarterly is happy to present this quick get-to-know-you guide. Be sure to stop any of these individuals should you spot them around campus, to ask them when's the next event or how to get your very own SOH CAH TOA t-shirt.<br /><br /><b>President - Raymond Taza</b><br />Now in his final year of Mechanical Engineering, Raymond initially became involved in the ECA last year, as VP Marketing and Communications. "I liked what the ECA had been doing during my time here at Concordia and I wanted to be part of that. I had been studying for two years and I felt that it was time to give back," explains Raymond. He has high hopes for an excellent year for the ECA, including special projects for the B-Annex, the student space, and ECA office in the Hall Building, as well as its administrative office. His hopes for the ECA are simple: to deliver the best time engineering and computer science students could ever wish for. Raymond has some friendly advice for all his peers in the Faculty: "all the things you can learn by getting involved with societies, competitive teams or just by attending events will broaden your education and will give you skills that cannot be obtained elsewhere."<b><br /><br />VP External - Agnieszka Koziol</b><br />Starting from her first year in Building Engineering, Agnieszka knew that the ECA organized great events that truly improved the quality of the university experience. It wasn't long before she decided to become involved in student life at Concordia, and applied for the position of Director of Internal Affairs with the ECA. "I can't tell you how impressed I am that a bunch of students can have the motivation and organizational skills to accomplish what I've seen the ECA and its societies pull off," she says with pride. Now the ECA's VP External, Agnieszka acts as a liaison between the ECA and external bodies. To keep everyone well informed, she's launched a newsletter by and for students in the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science. She hopes that the Engineering This Week will act as a medium through which student can learn about job and volunteer opportunities, contests, conferences, and much more, while also giving students a chance to share ideas and to practice their writing skills. With the first edition already on newsstands, Agnieszka is now looking forward to Engineering Week, which will take place in March. "I plan on making this the best Eng Week yet!" <br /><br /><b>VP Academic - Vijeta Patel</b><br />Now in her fourth and final year of a degree in Software Engineering, Vijeta wanted to get involved in the Concordia community while also doing something that was pertinent to her degree. Attending competitions and conferences related to computer science was important to her and this eventually led to her decision to take on an active role in the ECA. "I feel as if I'm making a difference in students' lives," she explains. "Without the ECA and volunteers, many activities simply wouldn't happen--going to school would mean just going to classes." As VP Academic, Vijeta's main focus is planning the Iron Ring ceremonies, but her responsibilities also include organizing tutoring services and maintaining the exam bank--services she dearly hopes students will take advantage of. She also hopes her fellow students will heed her call to get involved. "Getting involved was the best decision I have made in my life so far," she says with confidence. "It has enabled me to build my leadership skills, taught me technical skills and knowledge I would have never learned at school, and has acquainted me with some of the most awesome and smartest people I know. If you're not sure, just do it!"<br /><br /><b>VP Marketing &amp; Communications - Sandy Woo</b><br />As a future software engineer, Sandy Woo's primary interests lie in cell phones and laptops--a passion that makes sense for the ECA's VP of Marketing and Communications. Now in her fourth year with the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science, Sandy has been involved in so many aspects of the Concordia community that she was voted ECA's Most Active Student of 2009-2010. She's been an active member of the Executive of Software Engineering and Computer Science Society, and VP Web with the Concordia delegation for the Quebec Engineering Games. Sandy is also involved in the competitive side of student life, having participated in the Quebec Engineering Games and Computer Science Games for three years as well as competed in the ACM ICPC coding competition last year. What's more, she's the current president of the organizing committee for Computer Science Games 2011, which are going to take place this March right here at Concordia. Asked which event she's most looking forward to, Sandy's quick to answer:&nbsp; "the ECA Ski Trip has been on my mind since the day I left Mont-Sainte-Anne in January. It's an amazing opportunity to get away for the weekend, enjoy the slopes and meet a ton of new people."<br /><br /><b>VP Social&nbsp; - Shan Wain</b><br />Shan loves making a difference in his community, so it made sense for him to give back to the engineering students by joining the ECA as its VP Social. Currently in his third year of a Bachelor's in Industrial Engineering, Shan also hopes to be part of the delegation for the Engineering Games, while becoming more active with the IIE (see "Being Social" sidebar). His main goal with ECA, he says, is "to establish good relations with the ECA and its societies, and other faculty associations, while making sure students come to as many events as they can!" For Shan, Orientation Day was a particular highlight because that was when he "got to meet all the new students coming to Concordia for the first time!"<br /><br /><b>VP Finance - Hao Yin</b><br />Now in his third year of an Electrical Engineering Degree, the ECA's VP Finance, Hao Yin, says he has been involved in the ECA "since day one at Concordia. I attended numerous academic and social events organized by the ECA during my first year." Hao wanted to get involved in the association as ECE Representative last year to give back to the amazing Concordia community, meet more students and get to know the Faculty. Indeed, Hao is very involved in the Concordia community, having been part of the SAE Aero Design team for the last two years and having participated in the improvisation team of the Concordia Engineering Games. Looking at the year ahead, Hao says he's "really looking forward to the 2011 Engineering Week. The first week of March will see hundreds of students from across Quebec and Canada and maybe even the United States coming to our campus and brightening up the cold winter days with friendly competition." <br /><br /><b>VP Sports &amp; Competitions - Sergio Lando</b><br />Tired of living in the shadow of other engineering schools when it came to sports and competitions, Sergio Lando decided to do something about it by joining the ECA. "Concordia has a very deep talent pool," Sergio explains, "but performance in competitions on the provincial and national stage was somewhat shaky. I was hoping to upgrade facilities and stimulate interest for the several engineering competitions, and have Concordia be recognized as a powerhouse." A dedicated competitor, Sergio takes part in nearly every engineering-related event he can, including Concrete Toboggan, Engineering Games, the Troitsky Bridge Building Competition, the Quebec Engineering Competition and the Canadian Engineering Competition. Sergio encourages his classmates to get involved wherever possible: "It doesn't matter whether you're a professional welder or have never used a wrench in your life, the exchange of knowledge that happens between members of competing teams is invaluable education."<br /><hr><b>Being Social </b><br />To get the most out of their time with the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science, all students are encouraged to join one of the many targeted student-run societies and competitive teams that exist right here on campus. The ECA is affiliated with the following groups, all of which have websites that are linked to directly from the ECA homepage at ecaconcordia.ca<br />&acirc;¬¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-Conditioning Engineers<br />&acirc;¬¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canadian Aeronautics and Space Institute<br />&acirc;¬¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canadian Society for Mechanical Engineering<br />&acirc;¬¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concordia University Building Engineering Society<br />&acirc;¬¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Engineering Games<br />&acirc;¬¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Engineers Without Borders<br />&acirc;¬¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers<br />&acirc;¬¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Institute of Industrial Engineers<br />&acirc;¬¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; National Society of Black Engineers<br />&acirc;¬¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Society of Automotive Engineers<br />&acirc;¬¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Software Engineering and Computer Science Society<br />&acirc;¬¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Women in Engineering<br />Graduate Students also have their very own student group, the Engineering and Computer Science Graduate Association. This team represents the many graduate students pursuing their degrees within the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science and organizes event throughout the year to keep everyone connected.
