<b>MIE group wins prestigious art poster prize </b><br />
The Gallery of Fluid Motion, an annual contest organized by the American
 Physical Society Division of Fluid Dynamics, is arguably the most 
prestigious visualisation competition in fluid mechanics in the world. 
So it's eye-popping to learn that a poster submitted by Hoi Dick Ng, 
Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial 
Engineering, was selected as one of the winning entries!<br />
<br />
<div align="center"><img alt="Fluid-Poster.jpg" src="http://newsfeed.encs.concordia.ca/encs_test/Fluid-Poster.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0pt auto 20px;" height="286" width="440" /><i>Images from <font style="font-size: 0.8em;">the winning poster</font><br />
    <br />
  </i></div>
Ng and his colleagues--Mohamed Fayed, Rocco Portaro, Amy-Lee Gunter, 
Hamid Ait Abderrahmane--attended the event, which took place at the end 
of November in Long Beach California. There, their poster was observed 
by over 2,000 conference delegates and also selected for one of the 
event's three Milton van Dyke awards, in recognition for their 
extraordinary work.<br />
<br />
The group's photographic images will be published in a special issue of 
Physics of fluids - Album of Fluid Motion and will be permanently 
displayed on the APS-DFD gallery of fluid motion website. <br /><br /><b>Mecanica Solutions makes major software donation to Concordia</b><br />The 9th annual Recognition Ceremony of the Concordia Institute of Aerospace Design and Innovation was held at Concordia's Engineering and Visual Arts Pavilion on November 12, 2010.

Habrich, Judith Woodsworth, and Morty Smolash commemorate the Mecanica 
Solutions Donation</i></font><br /></div><br />Having provided engineering services to industry for nearly 30 years, officials at Mecanica are looking to the future with their donation to Concordia. As General Manager of the company's 360 Enterprise Software, Morty Smolash knows firsthand what the software would mean for our students. Smolash joked that "sparks are going to fly" due to the collaboration between Mecanica and Concordia--a sentiment echoed by&nbsp; Alex Habrich, president and CEO of Mecanica. Special thanks also to Dan Brisson, Cameron McKay and Sébastien Marcille at Mechanica for their invaluable help in establishing a solid partnership between Mecanica and Concordia.<br /><br /><b>Engineers without Borders push for Fair Trade certification at event </b><br />In late November, the Concordia Chapter of Engineers without Borders organized a special Fair-Trade-focused wine &amp; cheese event. In attendance were students from across the Faculty, professors, special guests, and Concordia's President, Judith Woodsworth. <br /><br /><div align="center"><img alt="EWB.jpg" src="http://newsfeed.encs.concordia.ca/encs_test/EWB.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0pt auto 20px;" height="292" width="440" /><font style="font-size: 0.8em;"><i>EWB Concordia President Jad Saleh addresses the crowd</i></font><br /></div><br />As the evening's Master of Ceremonies, Saleh took to the podium once the crowd had had the chance to mingle and sample the Fair Trade wine and chocolates thoughtfully provided by EWB. Saleh opened the evening with a warm welcome and spoke a bit about the history of Engineers without Borders before describing the real reason they had decided to throw a wine and cheese: to make the case for Concordia to become Canada's first Fair-Trade Certified university.<br /><br />Following Saleh's impassioned speech, Robin Drew, Dean of the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science, praised Saleh's hard work and lent his support to the Fair Trade cause, saying "hopefully we'll have some fair trade coffee in the Faculty soon."<br /><br />Judith Woodsworth, President of Concordia University, then echoed the Dean's sentiments, smiling widely as she recalled the Fair Trade coffee and chocolate given to her by EWB alongside their official pitch to have Concordia become Fair-Trade Certified. While she was not yet in a position to confirm that the University would be able to participate in the certification program, she gave the EWB hope in stating "we have an open mind."<br /><br /><b>CIADI holds 9th recognition awards</b><br />The 9th annual Recognition Ceremony of the Concordia Institute of Aerospace Design and Innovation was held at Concordia's Engineering and Visual Arts Pavilion on November 12, 2010. Present for the cocktail, speeches, and awards ceremony were past and present CIADI students, as well as professors, university representatives--including Provost David Graham, and industry leaders.<br /><br /><div align="center"><img alt="ciadi.jpg" src="http://newsfeed.encs.concordia.ca/encs_test/ciadi.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0pt auto 20px;" height="270" width="440" /><i><font style="font-size: 0.8em;">Marius Paraschivoiu with members of CIADI Global</font></i><br /></div><br />After the crowd had had the chance to mingle over cocktails and canapés, Robin Drew, Dean of the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science, shared some words of welcome. He spoke of the excellent partnerships CIADI had forged within Montreal's aerospace industry. Marius Paraschivoiu, Director of CIADI, echoed Dean Drew's positive outlook while looking back on an excellent year of progress for the Institute. Looking ahead to 2011, Paraschivoiu described how CIADI will expand to include professors from across the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science. He also mentioned the renovations that are currently underway to build more offices in the administrative area of the 12th floor of the EV Building, which is set to become the centre of aerospace training and research at Concordia University.<br /><br />It was, of course, the Institute's students, who were front and centre for the Recognition Awards. CIADI's president, Raîssa El-Haddad, alongside Vice President Karim Sarhan, they outlined the recent achievements of CIADI students, especially with regards to the past year's CIADI Global project. This special internship program was established in 2007 to expose participating students to the various obstacles and challenges faced by aerospace companies on a global level. In the 2009-10 academic year, CIADI sent five students to Europe, where they were given an invaluable opportunity to see other parts of the world while acting as ambassadors for Concordia.<br /><br />On the whole, the evening represented a discussion of the bright future of the Concordia Institute of Aerospace Design and Innovation, which is sure to make exciting announcements in 2011, when CIADI celebrates its first decade of achievements.<br />&nbsp;<br /><b>ENCS Grad wins Governor General's Award</b><br />This year's Governor General Gold Medal goes to PhD recipient Ramin Motamedi. His extraordinary work in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering put him at the head--not just of his class--but of all Concordia graduate students at this fall's convocation.<br /><br />Every year, the Office of Graduate Studies circulates the names of about 80 graduate students whose dissertations were deemed excellent or outstanding. Each Faculty determines which two of their eligible students should be selected and a committee of representatives from all four Faculties makes the final choice. "When I saw he was on the list of eligible students, I wanted to recommend him because of both the completeness of his thesis, and the usefulness of this research," says Motamedi's supervisor, Associate Professor Paula Wood-Adams.<br /><br />Motamedi's research project, Microcantilever-based Rheology of Liquids, developed a methodology to determine properties of minute amounts of higher viscosity fluids. To accept his medal, he flew in from Calgary, where he's already using putting his skills to positive use in the oil industry. <br /><br /><b>MIE alumnus honoured with National Aboriginal Achievement Award</b><br /><img alt="duncan-cree.jpg" src="http://newsfeed.encs.concordia.ca/encs_test/duncan-cree.jpg" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px;" height="207" width="220" />Canada's aboriginal youth now have a brand-new role model: recent Concordia graduate, Duncan Cree. In a November ceremony at the House of Commons, Cree--along with thirteen other leaders from the nation's aboriginal communities--was honoured with a National Aboriginal Achievement Award for his inspirational success.<br /><br />Cree, who is originally from Kanesatake, was drawn to Concordia by the aerospace option offered through the mechanical engineering program. While at Concordia, he excelled moving all the way from bachelor's to PhD. He recalls his time at Concordia fondly, saying, "alongside my engineering courses, Concordia gave me an education on the different cultures of the world." <br /><br />The National Aboriginal Achievement award is a "great honour to receive," says Cree, "especially when your own people have selected you. It shows that with some guidance, hard work, and determination anyone can achieve their dreams or goals." He hopes to impress this idea upon aboriginal youth across the country by sparking an interest in education through his recent win.<br /><br />Cree is no stranger to hard work and is now into the second year of a post-doctoral fellowship from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, which he holds at Queen's University. There, he is researching the rehabilitation and strengthening of concrete columns and bridges with externally bonded fibre reinforced polymers.<br /><br /><b>Major national award supports Ideas &amp; Innovation </b><br /><img alt="FQvatistas.jpg" src="http://newsfeed.encs.concordia.ca/encs_test/FQvatistas.jpg" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt;" height="220" width="220" />George Vatistas, Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering has been awarded a prestigious "Idea to Innovation" grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, to assist in the development of a marketable product based on scientific research. The grant, worth $115,452, will fund the development of a new type of compact heat exchanger that Vatistas and his post doctoral fellow Mohamed Fayed designed based on pioneering research into swirling flows.<br /><br />Because few research programs mature into marketability, these awards are a rare occurrence. Vatistas says he is honoured to be part of such a select crowd, noting that the award "shows that the work going on right here in the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science has great value, both academically and in industry."<br /><br /><b>GFI Advanced Technology Group helps CIISE solve cyber-crimes </b><br />
For members of the Concordia Institute of Information Systems 
Engineering (CIISE), having the right tools for the job can mean solving
 cyber-crimes before they even occur. These tools, of course, are a 
little more technical than the magnifying glass used by detectives of 
yore: nowadays, complex software systems help highly trained individuals
 to better understand how malware and viruses work. That's where 
software programs like GFI Sandbox come in--but with a hefty price tag 
of $56,000 it's a difficult thing to acquire.<br /><br /><div align="center"><img alt="GFI_web.jpg" src="http://newsfeed.encs.concordia.ca/encs_test/GFI_web.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0pt auto 20px;" height="281" width="440" /><font style="font-size: 0.8em;"><i>Robin Drew and Mourad Debabbi flank Chad Loeven at the GFI gift announcement<br /></i></font></div>
<br />
Enter Chad Loeven, alumnus from the Department of Electrical and 
Computer Engineering, and VP at GFI, which itself is a leader in the 
global security community that provides the industry's leading malware 
analysis tools. Thanks to him, GFI has now donated the Sandbox tool to 
CIISE in order to support graduate students conducting research in the 
security cluster. <br />
<br />
Dr. Mourad Debbabi, director of CIISE, notes that a tool like the 
Sandbox will allow his colleagues in the security cluster to 
reverse-engineer and safely test malware in a secure environment, 
thereby allowing researchers to see this malicious software in action 
while having the reassurance that it is contained. <br /><b><br /></b><div><b>Innovation touches down at Concordia</b><br />With Concordia at the forefront of aerospace research in Montreal, it's no surprise that a special visit from Bell Helicopter Textron drew a standing-room-only crowd. The presentation (a combined effort from the Montreal-Ottawa Chapter of the American Helicopter Society, Concordia's Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science, as well as its Office of the VP Research) saw Jeff Lowinger and Catherine Ferrie, two executives from the commercial helicopter giant, fly in from Texas to deliver a timely talk on the future of rotorcraft design and production.<br /><br /><div align="center"><img alt="AHS-Group.jpg" src="http://newsfeed.encs.concordia.ca/encs_test/AHS-Group.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0pt auto 20px;" height="292" width="440" /><i><font style="font-size: 0.8em;">From left to right: Jeff Lowinger, Robin Drew, Catherine Ferrie, Don Friesen (VP Engineering, Bell Helicopter Textron Canada), Robert Fews (Aerospace Special Advisor, Concordia)</font></i><br /></div><br />As the company's Executive Vice President of Engineering, Lowinger's focus is making--and selling--tomorrow's helicopters today. He explained that the work going on in industry was dependent on advancements in academia. "Your challenge," he said, addressing the rapt group of students and faculty members, "is to figure out how we make today's technology faster, cheaper, and more reliable."<br /><br />For Catherine Ferrie, Director of the company's "Xworx" division, the focus is similarly forward-thinking. As they tracks emerging technologies from a broad range of sources that can benefit the rotorcraft industry, Dr. Ferrie and her team develop technologies for integration into Bell's next generation products. From basic research through concept development, rapid prototyping and testing, the Xworx division interfaces with universities, small businesses and government labs in areas from structures and materials to sensor technology and aeronautics work. Although it was hard hit by the recent economic downturn, she was confident that the future of the aerospace industry was bright: "my job is to envision the art of what's possible to the market--that's why we work with universities."<br /><br />With a solid history of support for projects and internships within the Concordia Institute for Aerospace Design and Innovation through its Mirabel-based facilities, Bell Helicopter Textron has long affirmed its confidence in this University Robin Drew, Dean of the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science, said that the feeling is mutual. "The great turn-out from our students and faculty for this special lecture shows that aerospace research has really taken off at Concordia. This event has helped us strengthen our ties to Bell Textron, one of our most vital partners, by keeping the dialogue between industry and academia open and engaged." <br /><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>
