<i><font style="font-size: 1.25em;">The Concordia Institute of Aerospace Design and Innovation reinvents itself&nbsp; </font></i><br /><br />With over 50% of Canada's aerospace revenues coming from the province of Quebec, it is no surprise that Montreal has become something of a national headquarters for the industry. As one of the few places on the planet in which an aircraft can be built from start to finish, this city represents the ideal locus for advanced research and teaching on aerospace. Indeed, Montreal is among the largest aerospace clusters in the world and is home to every discipline necessary to put an airplane together, including aerostuctures, engines, landing gears, avionics and systems. What's more, approximately 41,000 people are employed locally within the aerospace industry.<br /><br /><div align="center"><img alt="CIADI-Group.jpg" src="http://newsfeed.encs.concordia.ca/encs_test/CIADI-Group.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="580" width="440" /><font style="font-size: 0.8em;"><i>The 2011-12 Class of CIADI<br /></i></font></div><br />Concordia's Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science has long recognized the importance of its placement within Montreal and the attendant necessity of an educational and research presence in the aerospace industry. Indeed, in order to support this important relationship between the industrial and university sectors, the Faculty established the Concordia Institute of Aerospace Design and Innovation (CIADI). Inaugurated in 2001, CIADI's original focus was to recruit students with a keen interest in aerospace and place them in industrial internships, where they would work on real-world research projects. Over the past decade, this program has helped many of our students go on to promising careers in the aerospace industry. It is a particular point of pride for this Faculty that, through CIADI, Concordia was able to initiate&nbsp; Montreal Aerospace Institutes (MAI), a strategic organization with a mandate to unite aerospace students in engineering or science from several Montreal institutions and enhance their training by introducing industry-driven courses, projects, university exchanges. <br /><br />The Faculty has also developed significant aerospace-related curricula: within the Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Department, an aerospace option is available in the Mechanical Engineering Bachelor's degree program; and, in a Faculty-founded partnership with several other universities, a Masters of Aerospace Engineering degree is offered. The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering is also showing leadership in Airborne Systems and Flight Control with new course options in Avionics and Control in the Electrical Engineering Bachelor's program and Avionics and Embedded Systems in the Computer Engineering Bachelor's program.<br /><br />The strong research relationship between this Faculty and the aerospace industry actually dates back over a decade. As a founding member of the Consortium for Research and Innovation in Aerospace in Québec (CRIAQ), the Faculty, with strong support from Concordia's Office of Research, was involved in the consortium's very first program concerning the design and manufacture of a composite wing box structure, which at the time was probably the largest thick walled graphite/epoxy structure ever built in Canada. The groundbreaking project (which also involved significant collaboration between Concordia, Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Limited, Pratt and Whitney Canada, the National Research Council of Canada's Advanced Manufacturing Technology Center, and supply chain companies) involved complex agreements between CRIAQ, Concordia, supporting industries, Federal and Provincial Governments and the US Department of State. The project was recognized by the Association de la recherche industrielle du Québec (ADRIQ) as a model collaboration and was awarded its prestigious Prix de partenariat. Our Faculty members in Mechanical, Electrical, Computer and Industrial Engineering have also been key participants in all five rounds of CRIAQ programs to date, working on projects involving materials developments, new structural applications, lean engineering, airborne systems and flight controls. As a result, strong research relationships have been developed with major original equipment manufacturers, as well as several major supply chain companies. <br /><br /><div align="center"><img alt="CIADI-Trio.jpg" src="http://newsfeed.encs.concordia.ca/encs_test/CIADI-Trio.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="382" width="440" /><i><font style="font-size: 0.8em;">Nadia Bhuiyan, Robert Fews, and Jayne Claassen</font></i><br /></div><br />Through initiatives such as these, the Faculty aims to turn Concordia University into Canada's preeminent provider of aerospace education and research. In order achieve this goal, CIADI is undertaking a renaissance of sorts. Under the leadership of its new director, Dr. Robert Fews, supported by associate director Dr. Nadia Bhuiyan (see sidebar), CIADI administrator Jayne Claassen and with the full backing of the Faculty, CIADI is expanding to become what will truly be a full-fledged aerospace institute. With the ultimate goal of establishing a solid aerospace curriculum across the Bachelor's, Master's, and PhD programs, CIADI is about to embark on an ambitious new phase. <br /><br />The next three years are set to be CIADI's busiest ever, as the forecast is to offer a Bachelor of Aerospace, an Executive Master of Aerospace (targeting mainly new recruits within industry, who would spend three weeks on the job for every one week in class during the 2-year program), and a PhD in Aerospace Engineering. In order to ensure that the new curricula associated with these programs are at the vanguard of both teaching and research, the faculty has established a Curriculum Development Committee under the leadership of Dr Martin Pugh (see sidebar). This committee in conjunction with internal curriculum development will expand CIADI's horizons. In this respect, important trans-institutional partnerships are being established and dual degrees could eventually be offered jointly through Concordia, in partnership with prominent international aerospace universities in Europe, India and Australia.<br /><br />CIADI has also begun to undergo a kind of rebirth of a more tangible sort, which can be easily seen in its newly renovated headquarters on the twelfth floor of the EV Building. Offices for CIADI's academic and support staff are now co-located there, alongside support facilities, meeting rooms, and lecture space. What's more, academic expertise is being diversified and strategic recruitment of new faculty is now underway, a greater emphasis on aerospace research is being embraced within CIADI, and affiliate professors from the industry are being sought for both research and teaching partnerships.<br /><br />Through all these changes, CIADI will continue to operate as it always has, working to promote awareness and provide leading edge know-how among engineering students in aerospace design and innovation. In order to enhance and complement the education of undergraduate students, CIADI will continue to conduct collaborative, industry-driven design and research internships and has established a new internship program development committee led by Dr. Bhuiyan with a mandate to strengthen and grow the existing program. With the 2011 students already selected and internships underway, the future is certainly bright for CIADI - and for the aerospace industry itself! &nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><font style="font-size: 1.25em;">Directing CIADI</font><br /><br /><b>Hany Moustapha - 2000-2007</b><br />The Concordia Institute of Aerospace Design and Innovation owes a lot to its founder, Dr. Hany Moustapha. With a BSc from Cairo University, an MEng &amp; PhD from McMaster University, and well over two decades on the job at Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada, Moustapha used his passion for academics and a strong sense of business savvy to help establish Concordia as a leader in aerospace. He worked closely with the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science and Concordia's senior administration in the late 1990s to turn his bright idea of offering aerospace internships to a select group of passionate students into a reality. He was known by many as a driving force and a great motivator whose persistence paid off - as is evidenced now by CIADI's continued success a decade after its founding. <br /><br /><b>Marius Paraschivoiu - 2008-2011</b><br />From Paris to Toronto, Quebec to Colorado, Dr. Marius Paraschivoiu's education and career path has taken him far and wide in pursuit of higher learning. Paraschivoiu is now a full Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering since 2010, where he has been teaching since 2003 after coming to Concordia from the University of Toronto. He was at the helm of CIADI from 2008-2011, and it was under his dynamic leadership that the institute was able to weather the difficult storm that befell the aerospace industry during the global economic downturn. <br /><br /><b>Robert Fews - Present Director</b><br />In late spring 2011, the Faculty named Dr. Robert Fews, a highly regarded innovator with extensive industrial experience, as director of the CIADI. Since 2009, he had held the position of Aerospace Special Advisor, a role that was established within the Faculty in order to build on the existing aerospace program and make it more relevant to the current needs of industry. Through his firsthand knowledge of the aerospace industry, Dr. Fews has been creating important research opportunities for the Faculty, including the development of an aerospace-related Senior Industrial Research Chair. During his two years as Aerospace Special Advisor, a role which will continue, Fews has made important inroads into the aerospace program development and played a vital role in promoting the Faculty's aerospace-related activities and programs internally and externally.<br /><br /><b>Nadia Bhuyian - Associate Director</b><br />Dr. Nadia Bhuiyan joined CIADI as Associate Director in 2002 to overlook the academic side of the Institute as well as to represent Industrial Engineering. The number of internships offered to Industrial Engineering students grew considerably and today, their demand in the aerospace industry continues to be strong. Dr. Bhuiyan's ongoing involvement concentrates on CIADI's regular operations, and her current focus is to increase industry participation in CIADI.<br /><br /><b>Martin Pugh - Director of the Curriculum Development Committee</b><br />Dr. Martin Pugh is the Chair of the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, a Fellow of the Canadian Society for Mechanical Engineering, a member of the Provost's Circle of Concordia University, and past recipient of the Teaching Excellence award from the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science. As the Director of CIADI's Curriculum Development Committee, Dr. Pugh will help establish important trans-institutional partnerships and dual degrees that could eventually be offered jointly through Concordia, in partnership with prominent international aerospace universities in Europe, India and Australia.<br />
