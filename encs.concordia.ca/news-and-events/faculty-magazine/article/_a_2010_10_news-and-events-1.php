<b>Julie Payette honoured alongside students at convocation </b><br /><img alt="ENCS-Convocation---June-2010-012.jpg" src="http://newsfeed.encs.concordia.ca/encs_test/ENCS-Convocation---June-2010-012.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0pt auto 20px;" height="330" width="440" />In June, 740 students were awarded degrees in Engineering and Computer Science during our spring convocation. Of note was the presence of Julie Payette, who received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty. She took to the podium with obvious delight after a warm introduction by Professor Marius Paraschivoiu, Director of the Concordia Institute for Aerospace Design and Innovation, and was met by thrilled cheers from the audience.<br />&nbsp;<br />Payette spoke with great enthusiasm of her passion for education and for engineering--something that drove her to follow her dream of becoming an astronaut. "I remember being 10 years old," she recounted, "and seeing astronauts on TV heading to the moon. I thought 'wow, I want to do that!'" She encouraged our graduates to keep up their own passions for exploration, discovery, and invention, and received a standing ovation from many in the crowd as well as on stage.<br /><br />Degrees were then awarded as ecstatic parents, friends, and family members showed their support by clapping, cheering, and even hooting vuvuzelas. Sven James, the ceremony's valedictorian, took to the stage in this festive atmosphere after the last degree had been presented, and, with great poise and composure, delivered a very thoughtful speech on what it means to be an engineer or computer scientist in today's world.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><b>BCEE professors recognized by national society</b><br />In mid-September, Catherine Mulligan and Adel Hanna, both professors in the Department of Building, Civil and Environmental Engineering, were honoured in Calgary at the 63rd Canadian Geotechnical Conference. Dr. Mulligan received a prestigious Stermac Award from the Canadian Geotechnical Society for her work as Chair of the society's Geoenvironmental Division from 2006 to 2010. Dr. Hanna was honoured with the Meyerhof Award, which recognized outstanding and significant contributions to the art and science of foundation engineering.<br /><b><br />Gopakumar wins technology and humanism award </b><br /><b>Govind Gopakumar</b>, Associate Professor within the General Studies Unit, was recently honoured with the Robert Boguslaw Award for Technology and Humanism. The award is given once every two years by the Environment and Technology Section of the American Sociological Association, in recognition of a a young, upcoming scholar whose work addresses technology and human affairs, social action and social change, conflicts over values, or work that proposes innovative solutions to emerging social issues associated with technology. <br /><br /><b>New Chair for GSU </b><br /><b>Deborah Dysart-Gale</b> was appointed Chair of the General Studies Unit earlier this summer.&nbsp; She obtained her PhD in 1999 from the University of Pittsburg and joined Concordia University in 2006 as Assistant Professor in the General Studies Unit.&nbsp; She has been Associate Chair of the GSU since 2007. Dysart-Gale has great plans for GSU, including coming up with a more appropriate name for the unit, as well as involving it in departmental activities such as Capstone and accreditation. Dean Robin Drew was pleased with the announcement, noting that Dysart-Gale's "consultative style and ability to listen to others are just a couple of the many great attributes that she brings to the job." <br /><b><br />Faculty Promotions</b><br />Congratulations to the following individuals, who received promotions over the summer:<br /><ul><li>Tenure - Drs. Mudry, Zsaki, Wuthrich and Qiu </li><li>Early Promotion to Associate - Drs. Li, Bentahar, Bouguila, Wang and Kadem </li><li>Professor - Drs. Zeng, Haarslev, Zhu, Bulgak, Packirisamy and Paraschivoiu </li></ul><br /><b>Faculty welcomes new members</b><br />The Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science is pleased to welcome five new assistant professors to its fold. They are: <br /><ul><li>Luis Amador and Liangzhu Wang - Department of Building, Civil and Environmental Engineering</li><li>Scott Gleason - Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</li><li>Roch Glitho - Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering</li><li>Masoumeh Kazemi Zanjani - Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering</li></ul><br /><br /><b>SAE a winner in California Competition </b><br />Concordia's chapter of the Society of Automotive Engineers met with great success at the Formula SAE competition, held in California in mid-June. After 22 laps, 32minutes : 38.026 seconds, and one very successful driver change, the Concordia FSAE team crossed the finish line and saw its first checkered flag in 15 years. The team was also one of the few to score points in all events, finishing even the most difficult event of the weekend, the endurance challenge, without so much as a broken clutch pin and with fuel to spare.<br /><br />Dean Robin Drew was especially pleased by the team's success, noting that "this marks a great finale to a lot of hard-work and dedication by everyone involved, but especially by those who are close to finishing their degrees but have decided to spend a 'little' time focusing on SAE activities this past year." Martin Pugh, Chair of the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, echoed Dean Drew's praise, saying that "it is truly impressive that the team finished the complete event--especially the endurance run."<br /><br /><b>IDEAS'10 at Concordia </b><br />The International Database Engineering &amp; Applications Symposium (IDEAS) was established by Bipin C. Desai, Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, in 1997. 2010 marked the fourteenth annual meeting in the IDEAS series and was hosted by the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science and CSE here at Concordia from August 16-18. It returned to Montreal after five years abroad, having been held in such diverse locations as India, Portugal, and Italy. <br /><br />The conference brings together academics, government and industry professionals to discuss recent progress and challenges in a broad range of areas in this domain such as data mining, databases, information retrieval, machine learning, as well as software engineering. <br /><br />For IDEAS'10, the tradition of inviting international experts in various aspects of database engineering to join the program committee was maintained. As a result, the Program Committee consisted of professionals from different parts of the world. The review process was followed by an on-line double blind debate; thus, the paper selection process for IDEAS'10 was thorough and competitive. About 17% of submissions were accepted as full research papers. <br /><br />The organizers of IDEAS are grateful to the ENCS building manager, Hospitality Concordia, the caterers and colleagues from CSE &amp; ENCS for their help in making this event a success. IDEAS travels to Europe next year and hopes to return, in a few years, to its alma mater.<br /><b><br />NSERC Solar Buildings Research Network celebrates 5th birthday </b><br />The NSERC Solar Buildings Research Network recently celebrated five years of groundbreaking research and cutting-edge activities with three days of special meetings at its Concordia University headquarters. These meetings culminated in a special daylong workshop that brought together SBRN researchers, industrial partners and potential new participants and collaborators to discuss research, development and demonstration initiatives. The day consisted of four panel discussions related to major research areas including net-zero energy housing, net-zero energy commercial buildings and communities and the building integration of solar energy systems. The workshop also enabled important discussions between industry, academia and government that are essential in the development of the next phase of the SBRN.<br /><br />The Network's director, <b>Andreas Athienitis</b>--Professor in the Department of Building, Civil and Environmental Engineering within the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science--felt that the workshop was a great success. "We are now in the final year of the present SBRN research program," he explained. "The Network has considerable achievements to show in its work. Many of its graduates have taken up faculty positions in Canadian and US universities and are playing a key role in the development of new academic programs and research initiatives aimed at developing the technologically advanced sustainable buildings of the future." The future is undoubtedly bright for the NSERC Solar Buildings Research Network, as Athienitis and his colleagues work on new funding initiatives, focusing on smart net-zero energy buildings and communities, to continue the work of SBRN.<br /><br /><b>Best papers from across the Faculty</b><br />The Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering is pleased to announce that Nizar Bouguila and his collaborators Drs.
